# Fuzzy Project 

## Context

In this project, I will be using fuzzy logic to develop a tip calculator in the Python programming language that takes into account the subjective ratings of food and service quality at a restaurant. Fuzzy logic is a mathematical tool that allows for the use of imprecise or subjective information to make decisions. It is particularly useful in situations where traditional logic may not be applicable or where subjective data needs to be taken into account. In the case of determining a recommended tip amount, food and service quality can be subjective and may not fit neatly into a traditional true/false or yes/no category. By using fuzzy logic, we can incorporate these subjective ratings and use them to make a recommendation for a tip amount that reflects the overall quality of the dining experience. To implement our fuzzy logic tip calculator in Python, I will use the “skfuzzy” library, which provides a set of tools for working with fuzzy logic in Python. I will define the input data (food and service quality ratings) and the rules that determine the recommended tip amount based on those ratings.
I will then test the calculator using a variety of input data to see how it performs.
